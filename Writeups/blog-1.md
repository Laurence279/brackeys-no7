## How I got here.

It's been a journey to learn game development. I've been wanting to learn game development for a long long time. It started years ago in high school when I learned how to write "guess the number" games on my TI-83? calculator. I never really got good enough to make something worth sharing. But that's okay. It was a start.

One of the things I've really always wanted to learn is how to make a game from scratch. No engines, no prebought assets, everything made by hand. 
About 10 months ago I found a post on Reddit in /r/GameDev that just said, "Stop over thinking and make your game." So I did, I kinda put one foot in front of the other and I started by finally understanding how ECS (Entity Component System) works. There was a very helpful talk done by one of the Overwatch developers for GDC that pointed out, It's rarely a 1 to 1 relationship for systems and components. 

Fast forward a couple weeks and I began the latest proof of concept for a multiplayer web game I'm calling _Robert Quest_. It's a short adventure game with a card system and virtually nothing else planned out. I learned an absolute ton about how to maintain state, and how to actually implement ECS. It was a massive step in the right direction. Fast forward a couple more weeks and I participated in my first game jam. It was terrible. But I finished. The theme of the Jam was "You are the Enemy" and a required object was a "Pen." I made Pen Breakout, A very poorly made game where you play as a farmer trying to sell your pigs and horses for sausage and glue. 

Pen Breakout was a personal success and milestone. I drew all the "Graphics", I wrote all of the code, and made the music, that didn't make it into the build because I forgot to add the include line. The game itself was horrible. There were tons of weird behaviors, no animations, the animal movement was literall just randomized. 

Skip a bit more and we're at today, with "It's Just the Wind." A fun little game where I was able to recruit and "artist" through a variation on Cunningham's law. Draw bad enough art, and someone will offer to do it for free.

## The tutorial 

Okay, for some reason you're still here and reading this, We're going to lay down the plan so you know what you're getting into. There are a few things I'm setting as expecations because I don't want to deal with them.

**Things you need**

* Visual Studio/Code - Some type of code editor, I don't care, that's not the point of this.
* Krita or another 2d art maker, Again, do not care.
* The basics of C# and working with Objects
* Dotnet SDK, preferably 5 or 6 (5 is going away soon)
